# 👋 Hello, I'm Rafi!
I’m a 2nd year cybersecurity student at Nottingham Trent University with hands-on experience in network security, information defense, and risk assessment. Currently expanding my knowledge through coursework, real-world projects, and a recent virtual internship with PwC Switzerland’s cybersecurity team. 

#### 📂 **What I’m Working On Now**

- Risk Assessment Framework: Developing a custom framework to evaluate and secure digital assets.
- Network Defense Lab: Designing and securing network architecture using firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection systems.
- Threat Mitigation Strategy: Collaborating on strategies to prevent common cyber threats like phishing and ransomware.


#### 🔍 **What I’m Looking For**

- Cybersecurity Internship/Role: Seeking opportunities to apply my skills in penetration testing, vulnerability management, and network security.
- Mentorship and Growth: Eager to join a team that fosters learning and allows me to grow as a cybersecurity professional.
